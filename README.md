# theScore "the Rush" Interview Challenge

### Installation and running this solution

It's assumed that you have docker installed

- Once this repo is pulled, 
- Open up a terminal, and run:
> docker-compose up


- Once that is finished running, the server should be available at http://localhost:4000
- Import with a valid json file and provide an optional name

- The File will be processed and then a link to the graphql interface will be provided, where the user will be able to search for any player given any part of the first name or last name.

(* if you hare not familiar with using graphQL, ctrl-space will guide you in what fiels are expected, or you can access the docs tab (on the right *)

I want to work on it some more (it's a lot of fun)... but I am getting a lot of pressure to hand something in by the recruiters and I am tired of the calls so I am submitting this interm build in order to satisy them

I want to work on the JSON export next
